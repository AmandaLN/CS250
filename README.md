Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories help break down the user needs into smaller workable sections. These are called sprinits and usually last 2-4 weeks. By having open communication and daily scrum meetings I was able to interpret the needs of the customer and implement them into the program

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I was very intrigued by the self-organizing team aspect. I think this is a great way to learn and develop your skills. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe to be a good team member is to complete the work that was given to you. If you are confused then simple ask for guidance and take responsibily for the errors and continue to learn from them.
